"""The HTTP boundary: what a request and a response are, and what a transport must provide.

The two protocols are the seam between the SDK and whatever HTTP library actually moves bytes.
Keeping them SDK-owned is deliberate: no third-party request or response type reaches the public
surface, and a caller can supply their own transport by satisfying :class:`HttpClient` or
:class:`AsyncHttpClient`.

There is no response *dataclass* here at all. A result carries the head as fields of its own, and a
body that has been read is ``bytes`` -- handed to a decode step or to an error mapper beside the
status it switches on. So the vocabulary at this boundary is three things: a request, a response
whose body is still on the wire, and the bytes that come off it.

The request and response shapes live here; the body shapes a request can carry live in
``bodies.py``, beside the factories that build them, and reach a transport through
:attr:`HttpRequest.body`."""

    It holds a connection until it is closed. Header names MUST be lowercased, the same rule the
    request side applies in ``_internal/headers.py``.

    ``read`` is the seam the error path and every buffered decoder take, not a convenience over
    ``iter_bytes``: it must both buffer the whole body *and* release the connection, so a body
    survives the close that frees the socket. Neither it nor ``iter_bytes`` may raise
    :class:`~.exceptions.TransportError`: that type is ``send``'s alone, and the retry loop reads it
    as "no response arrived". A body that fails once the head is in raises the library's own
    exception, which propagates in both response modes -- re-sending would repeat work the server
    has already done.

    ``iter_bytes`` re-chunks to ``chunk_size`` bytes when given an ``int``; given ``None`` it MUST yield
    each chunk as the network delivered it, buffering nothing of its own -- a latency-bound consumer such
    as an event stream reads it that way, since a fixed size would hold a twenty-byte event back until
    enough followed it.

    ``close`` MUST be idempotent. The runtime closes twice on one path: a buffered decoder releases
    the body in its own ``finally``, and a decoder that raises is then closed again by the seam that

class HttpClient(Protocol):
    """Sync transport contract.

    There is **one** request seam. ``send`` returns as soon as the response head has arrived and
    never reads the body; who reads it, and when the connection is released, is the decoder's
    business (ADR-0063). A transport that buffered would be answering a question nobody asked --
    and, underneath, the library this one wraps reaches a streamed response first in either case.

    Implementations:
    - MUST NOT mutate the incoming :class:`HttpRequest`.
    - MUST honour ``request.timeout`` when it is set, and fall back to their own configured
      timeout when it is ``None``.
    - MUST lowercase the header names on the returned response: HTTP/1.1 treats them
      case-insensitively and HTTP/2 requires lowercase, so a caller's lookup needs no case
      handling -- the same rule, for the same reason, as the request side in
      ``_internal/headers.py``.
    - MUST send ``request.headers`` as given and spell no header of its own: a body's label -- its
      media type as ``Content-Type``, and a raw body's name as ``Content-Disposition`` -- is already
      among them, folded under the parameter layers when the request was built, so a caller's
      ``extra_headers`` has already won. The one label a transport writes is a multipart body's,
      whose boundary exists only once its encoder has minted it.
    - MUST raise :class:`~.exceptions.TransportError` (``from <sdk>.core import TransportError``)
      when a request produces no response at all -- a refused connection, a dropped one, a protocol
      failure, a timeout -- or the retry loop never sees the failure, and MUST confine it to
      this method: the returned response never raises one (see :class:`HttpResponse`). That is what lets the retry
      loop and a caller both act on one shape whichever library moves the bytes; a loop that caught
      the library's own exception would have to import it to say so. The library's exception belongs
      on ``__cause__``, not swallowed.

    One obligation is this side's alone:
