"""The event stream's payload: a ``text/event-stream`` body not yet read, owning its connection.

``EventStream`` and ``AsyncEventStream`` join ``FileResponse`` and its twin as the runtime's non-frozen
classes, for the same reason: they own a resource with a lifecycle. Iterating one yields the typed payload
of each event as the server dispatches it. Every path that ends the iteration releases the connection --
exhaustion, the operation's sentinel, an exception, a ``with`` block, ``close`` -- and abandoning a partial
iteration is the one leak, reported by ``__del__`` (a ``ResourceWarning`` naming the URL) and reaped by the
client's own close, exactly as a file's is. A stream that is never iterated at all is reported the same way.

The parser is ``_internal/sse_parser.py``; this module decides what happens to what it yields. An event
whose ``data`` equals the sentinel ends the stream and is never surfaced. An event the declared type
rejects raises pydantic's ``ValidationError`` -- a ``ValueError``, exactly what a buffered body's decoder
raises -- after the close; raised, not skipped, because a silently dropped event in a token stream is data
loss the caller cannot see. The bytes are taken as the transport delivers them, ``iter_bytes(None)``, never
re-chunked: a fixed chunk size would hold a twenty-byte event back until enough followed it.

A finalizer here only ever *reports*, never acts (ADR-0007): nothing is closed at GC time, and the
consuming generator re-raises ``GeneratorExit`` without closing for the same reason."""

    ``for chunk in stream`` yields each event's decoded ``data`` and closes the connection when the server

        with client.streaming.create_chat_completion(request) as chunks:
            for chunk in chunks:

    Only a *partially* consumed iteration outside a ``with`` can leak; that case emits a ``ResourceWarning``
    at finalization, the same way an unclosed file does, and the client's own ``close()`` is the backstop.
    A ``break`` inside a ``with`` is the idiomatic early stop. Single-use: once closed, iterating again
    raises rather than yielding nothing. The per-call ``timeout`` applies to each read of the body, so it
    bounds the wait *between* events and a stalled server raises rather than hangs. Each open stream holds
    one connection from the transport's pool until it is closed, so many left open will make later
