"""The unset sentinel and the states it enables: omitted vs ``null`` vs a value.

:data:`UNSET` marks a field the caller never touched and :func:`strip_unset` is where "omitted" is
recovered at dump time, by dropping any key whose live value is still the sentinel. Two annotations
admit it, one per spelling a spec can declare: :data:`Optional` for a property that may be omitted,
:data:`OptionalNullable` for one that may be omitted *or* explicitly ``null``. See
``docs/designs/optional-nullable-fields.md``.

:data:`Optional` is deliberately **not** ``typing.Optional``. Here it means ``T | UnsetType`` --
present or absent, with no ``None`` arm -- where ``typing.Optional[T]`` means ``T | None``. They
differ by exactly the arm that matters: a property the spec does not declare nullable must not be
able to reach the wire as ``null``, so passing ``None`` to one of these fields is a type error
rather than a value that serializes. Nothing in a generated SDK imports ``typing.Optional`` -- unions
are spelled with PEP 604 ``|`` -- so the two never appear in the same module.

Both are plain generic aliases, not ``TypeAliasType``. pydantic substitutes a ``TypeAliasType``'s
parameter itself and folds ``Any | T`` into ``Any`` while doing so, which would take the sentinel arm
out of ``Optional[Any]`` -- the spelling of a property with no ``type``. ``typing`` substitutes a
plain alias and keeps the arm; mypy reads the two forms alike. See ADR-0071.

:func:`items_or_empty` is the one reading of a ``None`` or ``UNSET`` array as an empty one. A selector over
an array field returns it as modelled, and the pagination seams that consume it need a sequence; it lives
here, beside the sentinel it reads, so ``pagination.py`` and ``results.py`` can both import it."""

    where the tri-state is actually recovered), and dumps nothing else: a value its union's
    real arm failed to serialize is refused here, so it raises instead of going out as ``null``.
    See ``docs/designs/optional-nullable-fields.md``.

    A singleton, and identity-stable through every channel that could duplicate it: ``UnsetType()``
    returns the existing instance, ``copy`` and ``deepcopy`` return it unchanged, and unpickling
    reduces back through the constructor. Without that, ``model_copy(deep=True)`` would deep-copy
    the sentinel into a *second* object, and ``field is UNSET`` -- the natural way to test for
    it -- would start returning ``False`` on the copy. :func:`strip_unset` uses ``isinstance`` and
    so is immune either way, but callers should not have to know that. ``final`` is the same
    guarantee stated statically: a subclass would inherit ``_instance`` already set, so its

    ``UNSET`` is omitted, while one explicitly set to ``None`` stays ``null``.

    The mapping branch pairs the two by *key* rather than by position, because ``mode="json"``
    renders a non-``str`` key as text (``{1: "x"}`` dumps as ``{"1": "x"}``): an entry the dump
    renamed keeps its dumped form instead of misaligning the walk. ``list`` and ``dict`` are the
    whole container set on purpose -- an array and a map are what a spec can express, so they are
    the only shapes an emitted declared type nests, and they are the same two ``adapters.py``
    descends. A ``tuple`` or ``set`` passes through like any other value.

    Shape-preserving: a dict in, a dict out; a list in, a list out. The three ``cast`` calls
    are that invariant, which mypy cannot verify through the rebuild -- they keep the
    imprecision here rather than returning ``Any`` to every caller.
