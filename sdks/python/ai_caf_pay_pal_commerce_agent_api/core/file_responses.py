"""The streamed download's payload: a response body not yet read, owning its connection.

``FileResponse`` and ``AsyncFileResponse`` are the only non-frozen classes in the runtime, and
deliberately so: everything else is an inert value, these own a resource with a lifecycle. Every
consuming path -- ``read``, ``save_to``, a drained ``iter_bytes``, a ``with`` block, ``close`` --
releases the connection; abandoning a partial manual iteration is the one leak, reported by
``__del__`` (a ``ResourceWarning``, the io/socket idiom) and reaped by the client's own close.

A finalizer here only ever *reports*, never acts (ADR-0007): nothing is closed at GC time, which
is also why the consuming generator re-raises ``GeneratorExit`` without closing -- closing there
would run at collection time and silently suppress the warning that names the mistake."""

    """A response body that has not been read yet.

    Three ways to consume it, and all three close the connection::

        client.files.download(id).save_to("out.bin")      # streams to disk
        data = client.files.download(id).read()           # buffers, for a small file
        with client.files.download(id) as f:              # anything else
            for chunk in f.iter_bytes():
                ...

    Reading is what closes it, so only a *partially* consumed manual iteration outside a ``with``
    can leak. That case emits a ``ResourceWarning`` at finalization, the same way an unclosed file
    object does -- the mistake is made loud rather than quietly cleaned up (ADR-0007, amended).
    The client's own ``close()`` is the backstop: it disposes the pool, and any connection still
    held with it. Single-use: once closed, reading again raises rather than yielding nothing. One
    consumer per response: ``read()`` after a partially-driven ``iter_bytes()`` raises the
    underlying single-pass error. The per-call ``timeout`` applies to each read of a streamed
    body, so a stalled download raises rather than hanging.

    ``headers`` is the full response head -- ``ETag``, ``Last-Modified`` and friends cost nothing
    to expose since the head has already arrived; ``media_type``, ``content_length`` and
    ``filename`` are the three curated conveniences over it. ``filename`` is the server's own
    suggestion from ``Content-Disposition`` and is sanitised before it can name a path -- see
