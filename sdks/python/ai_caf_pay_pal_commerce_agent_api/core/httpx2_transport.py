    **The limitation this exists for, at source (httpx2 2.13.1).** ``MultipartStream.__aiter__`` is
    ``for chunk in self.iter_chunks(): yield chunk`` -- an ``async`` generator delegating to a
    *synchronous* one -- and ``FileField.render_data`` pulls each part with a plain
    ``self.file.read(CHUNK_SIZE)``. There is no ``await`` anywhere in ``_multipart.py``. So the
    encoder asks for bytes with a function call, and an awaitable source can only answer with one,
    and the two cannot meet: **both** async arms are affected, ``AsyncBinaryReader`` and
    ``AsyncIterable[bytes]`` alike, and neither can be driven from inside the encode at any cost.
    Draining first is not an optimisation, it is the only way either arm reaches the wire.

    A temp file is where it drains *to* because the encoder's demand is a synchronous ``read``, and
    that is the cheapest thing that offers one without holding the payload: each chunk is written
    straight out and dropped, so **nothing accumulates** -- the alternative that kept the bytes in
    the process peaked at twice the payload, measured (ADR-0051).

    **What bounds the residency is the chunk size, and only one arm's is the SDK's.**
    :func:`_awaited_chunks` reads a reader in ``_CHUNK_SIZE`` windows, so that arm is bounded here
    by construction. :func:`_aiter` forwards an ``AsyncIterable``'s own chunks unchanged, because
    re-slicing a ``bytes`` the caller already built would add a copy rather than remove one -- so
    there the peak is the caller's largest ``yield``, whatever that is, and a caller who yields
    their whole payload at once has already made it resident before this is reached. Either way
    this function's own overhead is one chunk, never the total.

    **The sibling limitation, so the two are not confused.** A *sync* ``Iterator[bytes]`` in a part
    hits the same ``read``-only demand from the other direction -- it can be pulled synchronously
    but carries no ``read`` at all -- and is answered by :class:`_ChunkReader`, a view rather than a
    file, because there is nothing to await and so nothing to drain. Same encoder constraint, two
    adapters, and which one applies is decided by whether the source needs an ``await``.

    Owning the encoder would retire both adapters and the loop-blocking with them. It was designed
    and declined: ``core/`` is vendored per SDK, so a bug in it ships everywhere and is fixable only
    by re-vendoring, and RFC 7578 escaping is the refusal that stops a CR/LF in a filename splicing
    a header into the body. If httpx2 ever grows an ``__aiter__`` that awaits, consume it -- do not
    write one (ADR-0051, ADR-0024).

    Why not the two other things that offer a synchronous ``read``. Accumulating into ``bytes`` is
    the defect this replaced -- it peaked at twice the source, once for the chunk list and once for
    the join. A ``SpooledTemporaryFile``'s ``fileno()`` forces a rollover to disk (measured), so it
    would reach disk for a ten-byte part *and* answer the encoder's length probe only by doing so;
    a plain temp file is smaller and needs no threshold to tune. Being a real file is also what
    keeps the part **sized**: the encoder reaches ``fstat`` through it, so this arm still contributes
    a ``Content-Length`` exactly as the resident ``bytes`` did, and stays re-sendable because it is
    seekable.

    A caller whose async source is a local file should hand over the ``Path`` instead: this arm
    then costs two reads and a write to move bytes that were already on disk in the right shape.
    Said in ``files.py``'s module docstring, where a caller reads it.

    Built from ``mkstemp`` rather than ``TemporaryFile`` so the object handed on is the same on
    every platform. ``TemporaryFile`` is an alias for ``NamedTemporaryFile`` wherever an open file
    cannot be unlinked -- Windows -- and that returns a wrapper proxying ``read`` through
    ``__getattr__``. A ``runtime_checkable`` protocol tests the *class*, so the wrapper does not
    satisfy :class:`BinaryReader`, and the part would fall through to the chunk-reader arm and go
    out chunked. Normalised here rather than branched on later.

    **Unlinked immediately where the platform allows it.** A POSIX file survives its own directory
    entry as long as a descriptor is open, so removing the name now leaves the content reachable
    through the handle and reclaimed by the kernel when the handle closes -- *including* if the
    process is killed, which is the one exit an ``ExitStack`` cannot unwind. Windows refuses to
    unlink an open file, so there the removal is deferred onto the stack instead. Probed rather than
    branched on ``os.name``: the question is what this filesystem permits, and the answer decides
    only *when* the name goes away.
